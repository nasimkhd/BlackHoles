        ><strong>Black Holes</strong> are one of the mysterious objects in the universe. By the
        time that the idea of black holes were born, Einstein was aware about
        them and had an mathematical equation about it which would show the
        result of their existence. Years after his death, Karl Schwarzschild
        officially announced the existence of black hole as the result of the
        general relativity.</dfn

    <p1 style="color: white"
      >Even though mankind has reached so far in the technology, just recently
      in last year we could spot a black hole in the space and get a picture
      from it which is not too transparent. This black hole is 27000 light years
      away from us. Due to the far distance in the space, we haven’t had the
      chance to identify them and research inside of it but we have lots of
      theory about them. The are few things that we have to know about the
      structure of the black holes. The boundary of the black hole is event
      horizon. The point that even the light with 300,000km/s cannot scape from
      it. When an object pass the event horizon it will be pulled inside of the
      black hole and goes deep down until it will be arrived at the singularity
      which is kind of impossible. The singularity is point that the gravity
      will be infinite and we have no other information than that.</p1

    <p1 style="color: white"
      >When a star dies by consuming all of its energy, all the mass of the star
      will be gathered in a small and tight point in the spacetime and suddenly
      a massive explosion happens in the space and in this situation there will
      be two options for the fate of the star: In the first scene, the star is
      transformed to a super nova which is a new generation star with different
      components. The second scene depends on the mass of the star, the star is
      transformed to a black hole. Black holes have a lot of mass which affects
      the spacetime and the insane gravity of the black hole can suck everything
      inside of it if the objects go further than the boundary of the black
      holes which is called Event Horizon.
